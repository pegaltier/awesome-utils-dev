# Web Browsers

## Chrome

### Extensions

# Text Editors

## Vim

### Plugins

- [Vim-Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - Git integration with Vim

  - Git Blame view where you can press Enter to jump to commit before a change was made to a line.
  - Git Status, Git Diff, etc

- [Vim-Dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) - Execute commands in a Tmux pane

  - Pulls results into Vim for easy paging and searching

  - Easy to script or run commands against selected files.



# Knowledge Management

## Cloud Solutions


- [Nuclino](https://nuclino.com)

A cloud-based outliner for taking team notes. More reasonably priced than competitors, and with a fluid UI.

- [Airtable](https://airtable.com)

Like Trello + Google Sheets.

I've heard a lot of buzz about Airtable lately and finally tried it out. It lives up to the hype I'd say. Provides Kanban like Trello, but with very flexible custom fields, different views, more powerful and seamless "powerups". Try the "group by" features - you can essentially turn *any* fields, custom or not, into its own kanban view. Extremely flexible.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so)

Like Nuclino + Airtable.

Instead of spreadsheets being the central model, an outliner knowledge base is. But they seemed to have stole much of Airtable's Kanban capabilities. While Airtable has a few additional features, Notion integrates with its building block/knowledge base approach, such that you can have essentially an outliner/wiki within each task, and you can also use double-square-brackets to link to other permanent nodes in the knowledge base.


## Documentation Tools

- [GitHub - GitbookIO/gitbook: 馃摑 Modern documentation format and toolchain using Git and Markdown](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)

Gitbook has a nice UI, and WYSIWYG editor support. The menu system just allows simple groupings, it could easily get cluttered.

- [GitHub - docsifyjs/docsify: 馃儚 A magical documentation site generator.](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify)

Docsify is awesome. Similar to mkdocs, but it is more hackable. Table of contents can get nested into sidebar routes from parsing markdown file headers automagically. It does have good search support, you just import a script with a single line of code.

- [GitHub - mkdocs/mkdocs: Project documentation with Markdown.](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)

mkdocs isn't as flashy as Docsify, but it seemed to have slightly less of a learning curve, like building a nested nav bar is done through a simple YAML config.

- [GitHub - facebook/Docusaurus: Easy to maintain open source documentation websites.](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus)

Docusaurus is Markdown + React based, and has grown in popularity recently as a Facebook project. UI is nice and it works well, but search seems only supported through Algolia, might not be a good solution for internal wiki.

- [Docz](https://www.docz.site/)

Looks awesome for being able to easily document and showcase your React components, easier than StoryBook


## Desktop Solutions

- [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io)

- Markdown-based
- Open source
- Sync over Dropbox or other file storage solutions

They had a mobile app at one point, but it is defunct. They plan on doing a rewrite.

- [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/) 

*The programmers Notebook*

- Markdown
- Snippets
- Notes

## Dotfiles

  - [Shawn Axsom](https://github.com/axs221/dotfiles)
    - neovim, fish shell, tmuxinator, Hyper.js, etc
